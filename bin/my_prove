=head1 Name

my_prove - Run MyTAP MySQL tests through a TAP harness.

=head1 Usage

  my_prove -D myapp
  my_prove -D testdb tests/
  my_prove sometest.sql

=head1 Description

C<my_prove> is a command-line application to run one or more MyTAP tests in a
MySQL database. The output of the tests is harvested and processed by
L<TAP::Harness|TAP::Harness> in order to summarize the results of the test.

Tests can be written and run as SQL scripts. If no files or directories are
supplied, C<my_prove> looks for all files matching the pattern C<t/*.my>. If
the tests fail, C<my_prove> will exit with non-zero status.

=head2 Test Scripts

MyTAP test scripts should consist of a series of SQL statements that output
TAP. Here’s a simple example that assumes that the MyTAP functions have been
installed in the "tap" database:

    -- Start transaction and plan the tests.
    BEGIN;
    SELECT tap.plan(1);

    -- Run the tests.
    SELECT tap.pass( 'My test passed, w00t!' );

    -- Finish the tests and clean up.
    CALL finish();
    ROLLBACK;

Now run the tests by passing the list of SQL script names to C<my_prove>.
Here’s what it looks like when the MyTAP tests are run with C<my_prove>

    % my_prove -u root sql/*.sql
    t/coltap.....ok
    t/hastap.....ok
    t/moretap....ok
    t/pktap......ok
    All tests successful.
    Files=4, Tests=216,  1 wallclock secs ( 0.06 usr  0.02 sys +  0.08 cusr  0.07 csys =  0.23 CPU)
    Result: PASS

=head1 Options Details

=over

=item C<-b>

=item C<--mysql-bin>

  my_prove --mysql-bin /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql
  my_prove -b /usr/local/bin/mysql

Path to the C<mysql> client program, which will be used to actually run the
tests. Defaults to F<mysql>, which should work well if an executable with that
name is in your path.

=item C<-D>

=item C<--database>

  my_prove --database try
  my_prove -D root

The name of database to use.

=item C<-u>

=item C<--user>

  my_prove --user foo
  my_prove -u root

The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the server.

=item C<-p>

=item C<--password>

  my_prove --password foo
  my_prove -p root

The password to use when connecting to the server. Specifying a password on
the command line should be considered insecure. You can use a MySQL option
file such as F</etc/my.cnf> or the F<.my.cnf> file in your home directory, to
avoid giving the password on the command line.

=item C<-h>

=item C<--host>

  my_prove --host mysql.example.com
  my_prove -h dev.local

Connect to the MySQL server on the given host.

=item C<-p>

=item C<--port>

  my_prove --port 1234
  my_prove -P 666

The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.

=item C<-t>

=item C<--color>

  my_prove --color
  my_prove -c

Display test results in color. Colored test output is the default, but if
output is not to a terminal, color is disabled.

Requires L<Term::ANSIColor|Term::ANSIColor> on Unix-like platforms and
L<Win32::Console|Win32::Console> on Windows. If the necessary module is not
installed colored output will not be available.

=item C<--nocolor>

Do not display test results in color.

=item C<-f>

=item C<--formatter>

  my_prove --formatter TAP::Formatter::File
  my_prove -f TAP::Formatter::Console

The name of the class to use to format output. The default is
L<TAP::Formatter::Console|TAP::Formatter::Console>, or
L<TAP::Formatter::File|TAP::Formatter::File> if the output isn't a TTY.

=item C<-a>

=item C<--archive>

  my_prove --archive tap.tar.gz
  my_prove -a test_output.tar

Send the TAP output to a TAP archive file as well as to the normal output
destination. The archive formats supported are F<.tar> and F<.tar.gz>.

=item C<-o>

=item C<--comments>

Show comments, such as diagnostics output by C<diag()>. Enabled by default.
use C<--no-comments> to disable.

=item C<--trap>

The C<--trap> option will attempt to trap C<SIGINT> (C<Ctrl-C>) during a test
run and display the test summary even if the run is interrupted

=item C<--state>

You can ask C<my_prove> to remember the state of previous test runs and select
and/or order the tests to be run based on that saved state.

The C<--state> switch requires an argument which must be a comma separated
list of one or more of the following options.

=over

=item C<last>

Run the same tests as the last time the state was saved. This makes it
possible, for example, to recreate the ordering of a shuffled test.

    # Run all tests in random order
    $ my_prove --state=save --shuffle

    # Run them again in the same order
    $ my_prove --state=last

=item C<failed>

Run only the tests that failed on the last run.

    # Run all tests
    $ my_prove --state=save

    # Run failures
    $ my_prove --state=failed

If you also specify the C<save> option newly passing tests will be
excluded from subsequent runs.

    # Repeat until no more failures
    $ my_prove --state=failed,save

=item C<passed>

Run only the passed tests from last time. Useful to make sure that no
new problems have been introduced.

=item C<all>

Run all tests in normal order. Multiple options may be specified, so to run
all tests with the failures from last time first:

    $ my_prove --state=failed,all,save

=item C<hot>

Run the tests that most recently failed first. The last failure time of
each test is stored. The C<hot> option causes tests to be run in most-recent-
failure order.

    $ my_prove --state=hot,save

Tests that have never failed will not be selected. To run all tests with
the most recently failed first use

    $ my_prove --state=hot,all,save

This combination of options may also be specified thus

    $ my_prove --state=adrian

=item C<todo>

Run any tests with to-dos.

=item C<slow>

Run the tests in slowest to fastest order. This is useful in conjunction
with the C<-j> parallel testing switch to ensure that your slowest tests
start running first.

    $ my_prove --state=slow -j9

=item C<fast>

Run test tests in fastest to slowest order.

=item C<new>

Run the tests in newest to oldest order based on the modification times
of the test scripts.

=item C<old>

Run the tests in oldest to newest order.

=item C<fresh>

Run those test scripts that have been modified since the last test run.

=item C<save>

Save the state on exit. The state is stored in a file called F<.prove>
(F<_prove> on Windows and VMS) in the current directory.

=back

The C<--state> switch may be used more than once.

    $ my_prove --state=hot --state=all,save

=item C<--rc>

=item C<--no-rc>

If F<~/.proverc> or F<./.proverc> exist they will be read and any
options they contain processed before the command line options. Options
in F<.proverc> are specified in the same way as command line options:

    # .proverc
    --state=hot,fast,save
    -j9

Additional option files may be specified with the C<--rc> option.
Default option file processing is disabled by the C<--norc> option.

Under Windows and VMS the option file is named F<_proverc> rather than
F<.proverc> and is sought only in the current directory.

=item C<-H>

=item C<--help>

  my_prove --help
  my_prove -H

Outputs a brief description of the options supported by C<my_prove> and exits.

=item C<-m>

=item C<--man>

  my_prove --man
  my_prove -m

Outputs this documentation and exits.

=item C<-V>

=item C<--version>

  my_prove --version
  my_prove -V

Outputs the program name and version and exits.
